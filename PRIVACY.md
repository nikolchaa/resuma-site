# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Resuma handles your data.

---

## 1. Data Collection

Resuma is a local-first application. By default, **no personal data is collected, transmitted, or stored on external servers**.

All resume content, settings, model files, and AI runtime binaries are stored locally on your device:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/com.resuma.app`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.resuma.app`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.resuma.app`

We do **not** track usage, collect analytics, or share any data with third parties.

---

## 2. Local Storage

The following data is stored **locally only**:

- Resume files (`.resume`)
- Application settings (`settings.resuma`)
- Exported resumes (PDF/TXT)
- Downloaded local models (e.g., Qwen3 GGUF)
- llama.cpp runtime executables

None of this data is uploaded, synced, or shared without explicit user action.

---

## 3. Future Features

If Resuma introduces optional cloud-based features in the future (such as support for OpenAI API integration), you will be **informed ahead of time**. These features will always **require explicit configuration**, such as providing your own API key and enabling the relevant runtime.

---

## 4. Third-Party Libraries

Resuma uses various open-source libraries and tools listed in [THIRD_PARTY.md](./THIRD_PARTY.md). These tools do **not** collect data unless explicitly stated.

---

## 5. Your Control

You have full control over all your data. You may delete files, settings, or models at any time using your file system or the in-app UI.

---

## 6. Contact

For questions or privacy-related concerns, contact: [contact@nikolchaa.com](mailto:contact@nikolchaa.com)
